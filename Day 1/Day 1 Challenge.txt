This is day 1 of my 100 days python challenge and I have to do the following:

1) Write a Python program to print "Hello, World!".
2) Write a program to add two numbers and print the result.
3) Write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle.


Starting a challenge without the hello World program will not be an abomination to the world of programming.
And the others are just basics.
I am so happy to start this, and I believe that at the end of it, I would be able to say I am no longer 
a beginner in python.
