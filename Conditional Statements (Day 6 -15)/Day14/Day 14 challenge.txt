Hey guys Today is day 14th of my 100 days coding challenge.
One thing to note is that never skip a day, and if you happen to skip one, 
don't skip two, cause it becomes a habit then.

Today I will
- Write a Python program to print all factors of a number.
- Write a program to find the sum of the digits of a number.
