Today is the 6th of July 2024, it marks Day 6 of my 100 days coding challenge
As from Today to day 15 I will be dealing mostly with conditional statements in Python.

So Today I will:
-> Write a Python program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
-> Write a program to check if a year is a leap year.
